            <h3><u>Cooking Steps - 8 simples steps</u></h3>
          <ol>
            <li> <mark>Prepare the Pepper Mix: </mark>In a blender, combine the chopped tomatoes, red bell peppers, <br> scotch bonnet peppers, and one roughly chopped onion. Blend until smooth.</li>
            <hr>
            <li><mark>Parboil the Rice (Optional but Recommended):</mark> Rinse the rice thoroughly. Bring a pot of water to a boil, <br>add the rice, and cook for about 5-7 minutes until it's partially cooked but still hard. <br>Drain and set aside. This step helps achieve a fluffy, non-soggy Jollof.</li>
                  <hr>
            <li><mark>Sauté Aromatics: </mark>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. <br>Add the finely sliced onions and sauté until translucent and fragrant, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
                  <hr>
            <li><mark>Cook the Tomato Paste: </mark>Add the tomato paste to the pot and fry for about 5-7 minutes,<br> stirring continuously, until it darkens slightly. This removes the raw tomato taste.</li>
                  <hr>
            <li><mark>Add the Pepper Mix:</mark> Pour the blended pepper mix into the pot. Stir well and bring to a simmer. <br>Cook for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the oil starts to float to the top. <br>This indicates the water has cooked out.</li>
                  <hr>
            <li><mark>Season the Sauce: </mark>Add the curry powder, thyme, bay leaves, salt, black pepper, <br>and seasoning cubes (if using) to the sauce. Stir thoroughly and let it cook for another <br>5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
                  <hr>
            <li><mark>Combine Rice and Sauce:</mark> Add the parboiled rice to the pot with the sauce. <br>Pour in the chicken or beef stock (or water with bouillon cubes). The liquid should just cover the rice. <br>Stir gently to combine everything.</li>
                  <hr>
            <li><mark>Cook the Jollof:</mark> Cover the pot tightly with a lid, preferably lined with foil or parchment paper to trap steam. <br>Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 20-30 minutes, or until the rice is tender and all the liquid has been absorbed. <br>Avoid stirring too much during this stage to prevent the rice from getting mushy.</li>
                  <hr>
            <li><mark>Achieve "Smoky" Flavor (Optional):</mark> Towards the end of the cooking time,<br> you can increase the heat slightly for a few minutes without stirring. <br>This helps create the beloved "bottom pot" or "smoky" effect. <br>Be careful not to burn it!</li>
                  <hr>
            <li><mark>Rest and Serve:</mark> Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the Jollof rice rest, still covered, for another 10-15 minutes. <br>This allows the steam to finish cooking the rice evenly. <br>Fluff with a fork, stir in butter if desired, remove bay leaves, <br>and serve hot with grilled chicken, fried plantain, or coleslaw.</li>
                  <hr>
