                  <u>Cooking Steps - 8 simples steps</u>
            </h3>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li> <span class="foodSteps">Prepare the Pepper Mix: </span>In a blender, combine the chopped tomatoes, red bell peppers,  scotch bonnet peppers, and one roughly chopped onion. Blend until smooth.</li>
                <li><span class="foodSteps">Parboil the Rice (Optional but Recommended):</span> Rinse the rice thoroughly. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add the rice, and cook for about 5-7 minutes until it's partially cooked but still hard. <br>Drain and set aside. This step helps achieve a fluffy, non-soggy Jollof.</li>
                <li><span class="foodSteps">Sauté Aromatics: </span>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the finely sliced onions and sauté until translucent and fragrant, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
                <li><span class="foodSteps">Cook the Tomato Paste: </span>Add the tomato paste to the pot and fry for about 5-7 minutes, stirring continuously, until it darkens slightly. This removes the raw tomato taste.</li>
                <li><span class="foodSteps">Add the Pepper Mix:</span> Pour the blended pepper mix into the pot. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Cook for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the oil starts to float to the top. This indicates the water has cooked out.</li>
                <li><span class="foodSteps">Season the Sauce: </span>Add the curry powder, thyme, bay leaves, salt, black pepper, and seasoning cubes (if using) to the sauce. Stir thoroughly and let it cook for another 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
                <li><span class="foodSteps">Combine Rice and Sauce:</span> Add the parboiled rice to the pot with the sauce. Pour in the chicken or beef stock (or water with bouillon cubes). The liquid should just cover the rice. Stir gently to combine everything.</li>
                <li><span class="foodSteps">Cook the Jollof:</span> Cover the pot tightly with a lid, preferably lined with foil or parchment paper to trap steam. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 20-30 minutes, or until the rice is tender and all the liquid has been absorbed. Avoid stirring too much during this stage to prevent the rice from getting mushy.</li>
                <li><span class="foodSteps">Achieve "Smoky" Flavor (Optional):</span> Towards the end of the cooking time, you can increase the heat slightly for a few minutes without stirring. This helps create the beloved "bottom pot" or "smoky" effect. Be careful not to burn it!</li>
                <li><span class="foodSteps">Rest and Serve:</span> Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the Jollof rice rest, still covered, for another 10-15 minutes. This allows the steam to finish cooking the rice evenly. Fluff with a fork, stir in butter if desired, remove bay leaves, and serve hot with grilled chicken, fried plantain, or coleslaw.</li>
